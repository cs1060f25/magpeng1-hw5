Prompt for Windsurf (5.2 SQL Injection): 

I have a vulnerable query that looks like the below:
sql = f"select * from county_health_rankings where county = '{county}' and state = '{state}' and measure_name = '{measure_name}'"

The endpoint accepts JSON with fields like {"zip":"84601","measure_name":"Adult obesity"}. I'm testing the safety of this to bad actors, so need to come up with possible sql attacks they will use to terminate the "Adult obesity" string early and add an OR clause so that all rows match the query. Assume I also need to add LIMIT 100 to prevent from downloading too much data. How can I modify the measure_name field to achieve this?

Prompt for Windsurf (5.3 Vulnerability Scanner):

I need to create a Python vulnerability scanner for CS1060 HW5 that:
1. Scans localhost (127.0.0.1) for open TCP ports below 9000
2. Tests each open port for HTTP basic authentication and SSH password authentication
3. Uses these credentials: {'admin': 'admin', 'root': 'abc123', 'skroob': '12345'}
4. Prints successful connections in RFC 3986 format (protocol://user:pass@host:port) followed by server output
5. Handles exceptions silently without printing errors
6. Has optional verbose mode with -v flag

Can you help me implement this scanner using socket programming for port scanning, requests library for HTTP testing, and paramiko for SSH testing?
